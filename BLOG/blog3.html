            <h2>Welcome to Food Blog!!</h2>
            <p>Tofu! Familiar to some and bizarre to many. It can be baked, fried, sautéed, marinated, scrambled – in short: it can really do it all. And newsflash: you don’t need to be vegetarian to partake!

                Tofu is high in protein and low in fat, and is a great alternative in many dishes that have meat. It can be cooked in a flash and served in SO many ways (see below!). Honestly, it’s truly just the best.</p>
          
                <p>Baked Tofu is a great way to prepare a large quantity of chewy bites of tofu that can get tossed with sauce and added to noodle bowls and or a stir fry. This method is also helpful because it frees up stove top space while preparing other elements of your recipe.

                    Press extra firm tofu for at least 30 minutes. Cut tofu into cubes or slabs and place in a glass dish.</p>
          

            <p>If you want to stick with baking but are looking for a little/a lot more crispiness, this method will change your tofu life. If you try just one method, this is hands-down our favorite way to do it.</p>
           
            <p>his crispy tofu can be tossed with a sauce after cooking for extra flavor. We used triangles of tofu, but cubed or sliced tofu works well with this cooking method, too. If cooking cubed tofu, flip onto all sides during the cooking process to ensure even crispiness.

                If desired you can add a sauce toward the end of the cooking process and flip tofu over to coat and allow sauce to brown at the edges. If planning to add sauce during cooking process, use slightly less oil while frying to avoid splattering and an overly oily sauce.</p>
